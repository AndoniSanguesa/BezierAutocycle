# 1. Each array below is a piece of input data for each obstacle.
# 2. Every array below should be a 2D array. Each subarray is a different frame.
#    Within each frame, the data of each object should be inputted starting from object 1 to object n
# 3. Each frame should have the same number of data from data type to data type
#    (i.e if the first frame in gamma has two pieces of data,
#    the first frame in edge_len should have two pieces of data)
# 4. Run this file and it will create the data in TestData
# 5. Run the bezier_visualization.py file

# You don't need to worry about anything past line 28
